I have been a christian for more than 10 years and stay hopeful to remain in the faith. My journey started when I was merely a child in my mother's house. I am a beautiful mixture of Kenyan and South African blood and find myself being the last of five children. I was born in Kenya and then moved to South Africa at the age of two. My father was an exile, we came back to South Africa when apartheid was finally ending. My father was a lecturer in Limpopo where I spent most of my childhood. My parents took us to church on Sundays, Lutheran church. I remember how my dad used to give us offering money when we went to church on Sundays, I would offer maybe 10% of it and keep the rest for myself. Haha!!!

According to the doctors, I had a tumour growing right on my right ovary. The tumour and my right ovary were surgically removed and in a week I was back to my old-self. I moved on to middle school, middle school brought big changes in my life because we moved to a new province, my dad's home village. What was also significant about middle school is that I started to feel sick again. When it came around to high school I was really sick, the tumour was back.

After a series of tests, we found out I had cancer and it had spread. I remember saying out loud to God "God, we are going to beat this cancer together, you and me". This time, I had to go through surgery, chemotherapy and radiation therapy to be rid of the cancerous tumour. It was a bitter and sweet moment for me, I treasure both and would not trade them for anything. Bitter, because it would take all of me to fight the disease and still I was left with deep scars to carry. Sweet, because that season of my life came to define the very core of who I would become, cancer redefined my life. The bitter and sweet have become part of me in ways I cannot articulate.')]),e._v(" "),o("p",[e._v("I went to university and this is where God began to give me the tools of ministry.
