I have been a christian for more than 10 years and stay hopeful to remain in the faith. My journey started when I was merely a child in my mother's house. I am a beautiful mixture of Kenyan and South African blood and find myself being the last of five children. I was born in Kenya and then moved to South Africa at the age of two. My father was an exile, we came back to South Africa as apartheid was bidding farewell. My father was a lecturer in Limpopo where I spent most of my childhood. My parents took us to church on Sundays, Lutheran church. I remember how my dad used to give us offering money when we went to church on Sundays, I would offer maybe 10% of it and keep the rest for myself. Haha!!! Little did I know who I was stealing from.</p> <p>Fast forward to my last year of primary school, I remember this year because it was the year I fell sick. According to the doctors, I had a tumour growing right on my right ovary. The tumour and my right ovary were surgically removed and in a week I was back to my old-self. I moved on to middle school, middle school brought big changes in my life because we moved to a new province, my dad's home village. What was also significant about middle school is that I started to feel sick again. When it came around to high school I was really sick, the tumour was back. Or was it really, only just a tumour.</p> <p>The doctor said the tumour had grown to a size of a tennis ball, wow!!! After a series of tests, we found out I had cancer and it had spread. I remember saying out loud to God &quot;God, we are going to beat this cancer together, you and me&quot;. This time, I had to go through surgery, chemotherapy and radiation therapy to be rid of the cancerous tumour. It was a bitter and sweet moment for me, I treasure both and would not trade them for anything. Bitter, because it would take all of me to fight the disease and still I was left with deep scars to carry. Sweet, because that season of my life came to define the very core of who I would become, cancer redefined my life. The bitter and sweet have become part of me in ways I cannot articulate.</p> <p>I went to university and this is where God began to give me the tools of ministry. I joined a church which I called home for more than 10 years and was involved in the student christian society at the university. I began to study the word, serve with fellow christians and became planted in my community church. I completed Bible school and various other courses which were provided in my church. After graduating I joined a programme at church where I dedicated a year of my life to serving and learning from the church pastors and leaders. Presently, I have moved to a new city where I am again planted in a Bible based church and involved in various minitries such as dance, hospitality and outreach. However, my first love is the Word of God.</p> <p>I have come to love the Word of God as I have continued to journey with God in my life. This Word is an anchor for my life and the reason I have started this blog. I firmly believe that there is no question the Word of God does not have answers to, there between pages of scripture lie the answers, there we will find answers to all the deep questions in our hearts and there lies the hope for our world.</p> <p>I believe in God the Father, Son and Holy Spirit. I believe that Jesus Christ is the son of God who died for the sins of the world. I believe that salvation is the gift of God by faith through the begotten son of God. I believes that all scripture is God's Word and carries the very breath of God. Scripture is useful to teach, rebuke, correct and train us in what is right. I invite you on this journey with me, I endeavour to search the Bible for answers to questions that plaque us in the 21st century. But I encourage you reader, don't take my word for it, open the scriptures and let the word speak to you too.</p> <h4 id="contact-me-atienokgokong-gmail-com"><a href="#contact-me-atienokgokong-gmail-com" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Contact me: atienokgokong@gmail.com</h4></div> <div class="page-edit"><!----> <!----></div> <!----> </div> <!----></div></div>
