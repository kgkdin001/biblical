It is defined as the advocacy of women’s rights on the ground of equality of the sexes. Feminism found its origin in the 19th century as the first wave of feminism emerged in the United Kingdom and later in the United States of America. The first wave of feminism would give birth to the second wave, the second wave in turn gave birth to the third wave and so forth and so forth. Thus, the feminism movement grew in popularity to reach our world today. When we look back at the trail of the feminism movement, we should all agree that feminism has made legitimate and valuable contributions to our society ‘s view of women.</p> <p>Some of these contributions include: addressing cultural and political inequalities, property rights for women, addressing the injustices of sexual harassment and violence against women…etc. The anger and frustration that drove feminism’s history is legitimate; women have been devalued and dishonoured ever since the fall of man. Very real, harmful inequities needed to be addressed, and it’s important to honour some of the success of feminist activists. However, the feminism movement has also taught that men and women are fundamentally the same, argued that gender roles are socially constructed and empowered women to be completely self-sufficient among other things. The Christian should ask…is feminism Biblical? Could it be that feminism has gone too far in addressing the inequities of living in a fallen world? For the Christian who indeed desires to know answers to these questions it would be wise to continue reading.</p> <h2 id="back-to-the-beginning"><a href="#back-to-the-beginning" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Back to the Beginning</h2> <p>Let us create mankind in our own image to rule and have dominion over the earth…in the image of God He created them, male and female… God blesses them and said to them “be fruitful…fill the earth and subdue it…rule over every living creature that moves on the ground” (Genesis 1:26-28). From the beginning, God puts a distinction between the two creatures He created in His own image (i.e. male and female).  Furthermore, He gives both male and female dominion and rule over all He created. How incredible, that the supreme ruler would hand over so much power and authority to mankind, both male and female.</p> <p>Now, Genesis 2:18 gives a detailed account of the creation of the first woman “Eve”. The Lord God said “it is not good for the man to be alone, I will make a helper suitable for him.” So the Lord God caused the man to fall into a deep sleep, He took one of the man’s ribs and made a woman from the rib, and He brought her to the man (Genesis 2: 21-22). Two things are astounding for me in this passage, firstly, the woman Eve is formed from Adam’s rib and secondly, she is said to be a suitable helper for the man. After creation God gives both Adam and Eve, the dominion mandate i.e. multiply, fill the earth and subdue it (Genesis 1: 26-28), in addition for Eve, God calls her a suitable helper for the man Adam. A helper she became and together with her husband Adam they had children and multiplied. It would seem that it was on God’s mind to make mankind stewards of all He had created on the earth withholding absolutely nothing from them.</p> <p>The greatest commandment and great commission
We know through reading Genesis 3 that Adam and Eve disobeyed God and sinned against Him in the Garden. What the first man Adam failed to do, the second man Adam (i.e. Jesus) fulfilled 2000 years later on the cross through dying for the sins of all mankind; present, past and future (1 Corinthians 15:45). While teaching His disciples Jesus says; love God and love people, there is no commandment greater than these (Mark 12: 30-31). Additionally, after His resurrection from the dead Jesus gives what is now known as the great commission in Matthew 28: 19-20. Jesus said, go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit and teach them to obey all that I have commanded you and I will be with you. We can be worried and upset about many things in this world that we live in, but few things are needed, or indeed only one; to do the will of God (Luke 10:41-42)</p> <h2 id="women-in-the-bible"><a href="#women-in-the-bible" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Women in the Bible</h2> <h3 id="she-is-brave-deborah-judges-4-and-5"><a href="#she-is-brave-deborah-judges-4-and-5" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> She is Brave: Deborah (Judges 4 and 5)</h3> <p>A prophetess and wife of Lappidoth, Deborah was the Leader of Israel during the time of Judges. During this time, Jabin King of Cannan had oppressed the Israelites for 20 years and the people cried out to the Lord for help and He answered. The Lord gave Barak son of Abinoam a word through Deborah the prophetess to take with him ten thousand men and go against the king of Cannan Jabin and the Lord will grant him victory.  However, Barak’s response was “if you go with me, I will go but if you don’t’ go with me, I won’t go.” Deborah proceeded to say, “certainly, I will go with you, but the honour will not be yours, for the Lord will deliver our enemies into the hands of a woman.” Indeed the Lord did. The story of Deborah teaches us that there are certain roles that the Lord has designed for men, however, God in His sovereignty is willing to raise up women in instances where men fail to rise to the occasion. Therefore, it is important for women and men alike to stay in tune to God’s voice and command instead of following popular opinion.</p> <h3 id="she-is-queen-esther-the-book-of-esther"><a href="#she-is-queen-esther-the-book-of-esther" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> She is Queen: Esther (the book of Esther)</h3> <p>The story of queen Hadassah, commonly known as queen Esther is a powerful story where opportunity meets destiny. Esther became Queen and wife of King Xerxes who ruled over 127 provinces through successive events that could have only been orchestrated by God. Esther saved her people from extinction through risking her life by faith and thus winning favour with the king. The story of Esther teaches us that our lives have a purpose and this purpose is connected to a greater purpose in God. Also, we learn that even in our position of honour as daughters of the most high God, we must be willing to lay our lives down for the greater purpose.</p> <h3 id="she-is-wise-abigail-1-samuel-25"><a href="#she-is-wise-abigail-1-samuel-25" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> She is Wise: Abigail (1 Samuel 25)</h3> <p>The Bible says Abigail was beautiful and intelligent, but Nabal her husband was a fool and given to drunkenness. The Lord used Abigal to save her people from the sword of David after Nabal had treated David the servant of God with contempt. Abigail acted quickly and wisely after she heard about the evil her husband had done. Abigail represents a woman who has discernment and applies her intellect to quickly solve problems. She also represents a woman who is devoted to peace and shows love and care to those around her.</p> <h3 id="she-is-leader-priscilla-acts-18-19-acts-26-romans-16-3-5-1-cor-16-19-2tim-4-9"><a href="#she-is-leader-priscilla-acts-18-19-acts-26-romans-16-3-5-1-cor-16-19-2tim-4-9" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> She is Leader: Priscilla (Acts 18 &amp; 19; Acts 26; Romans 16:3-5; 1 Cor 16:19; 2Tim 4:9)</h3> <p>Priscilla who is always mentioned alongside her husband Aquila was a leader in the early church and together with her husband helped carry out the work of the ministry as well as support the Apostle Paul in his commission to be an Apostle to the Gentiles. Priscilla and her husband were knowledgeable in the scriptures and even instructed a preacher named Apollos more adequately in the word. They held church at their house and risked their lives to support the Apostle Paul, he even calls them “co-workers” in preaching the gospel. The Bible is very specific in mentioning Priscilla alongside her husband in all these works of service for The Lord, I believe that this should inform us that she was actively involved in preaching the gospel and leading the early church with her husband. Priscilla is a beautiful picture of a woman of faith who submits both to God and her husband, who has been called to be a preacher and a leader as well as pioneer to the great commission all in one.</p> <h3 id="she-is-humble-mary-luke-1-26-38-luke-2-matt-12-46-50-john-19"><a href="#she-is-humble-mary-luke-1-26-38-luke-2-matt-12-46-50-john-19" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> She is Humble: Mary (Luke 1:26-38; Luke 2; Matt 12: 46-50; John 19)</h3> <p>Mary the mother of our Lord and saviour Jesus Christ is introduced to us in the four books of the gospel. It is said that the angel Gabriel appears to her and tells her that she would be with child and that the child would be the saviour of the world. Without argument nor contention Mary said “let it be as you have said” and she spent her time pondering upon the truths that the angel had told her. Mary gave birth to Jesus and watched him grow into a man who would later leave home in pursuit of His God given purpose. Mary knew that Jesus was never hers to keep, she released Him to the world that would slay him though He did no wrong and eventually crucify Him. She helplessly watched as he suffered, bled, wept and died as He hung on the cross. The son that was a promise, then a seed planted in her womb, later a baby she would raise and finally a man of sorrow who died for the sins of many. Mary teaches us an important lesson; it is not about us. This life we live, these gifts we possess, the purposes we are called to and everything we have is given us for God’s glory and no other reason.</p> <h3 id="she-is-faithful-anna-luke-2-36-38"><a href="#she-is-faithful-anna-luke-2-36-38" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> She is Faithful: Anna (Luke 2: 36-38)</h3> <p>The Bible in two verses speaks about the prophetess Anna. An eighty four year old widow who never left the temple of the Lord but worshiped day and night. God honours Anna by allowing her see with her own eyes the saviour Jesus Christ in her old age when Joseph and Mary visit the temple. She gave thanks to God and began to speak of Jesus to all who were expecting the coming of the saviour. Anna lost her husband after 7 years of marriage but she was neither dismayed nor discouraged. She took up her post as prophet and intercessor in her generation remaining faithful to God. May it also be said of the 21st century Christian woman, that she served the Lord in her generation day and night and she never left her post.</p> <h3 id="she-is-proverbs-31-woman-proverbs-31-10-31"><a href="#she-is-proverbs-31-woman-proverbs-31-10-31" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> She is Proverbs 31 Woman (Proverbs 31: 10-31)</h3> <p>Proverbs 31 speaks of a super woman who seemingly does anything and everything she sets her mind upon. She is a woman of noble character. She is wife, mother, boss, wise, elegant, strong, homemaker and daughter of the most high God. It is said of her “she fears the Lord and should be praised.” Any Christian woman who has been called to marriage has a great role model in the Proverbs 31 woman. She is the epitome of Proverbs 18:22 that states; he who finds a wife finds a good thing and obtains favour with the Lord. The Proverbs 31 woman teaches us that it begins and ends with the fear of the Lord, for one who fears the Lord shuns and renounces evil (Job 28:28; Proverbs 8:13) and obtains wisdom from the Lord (Proverbs 9:10).</p> <h2 id="conclusion"><a href="#conclusion" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Conclusion</h2> <p>There are many women in the Bible that we can reflect on to gain wisdom and understanding into the purposes God has specifically designed for women. From the few women we have discussed it is clear that women are created equal to men but different in form and function. Conversely, the feminism movement teaches that women are created equal to men and the same in form and function. This feminism teaching and ideology is flawed, unbiblical and carnal to the core. The 21st century Christian woman should reject anything that lifts itself above the knowledge and truth of scripture in any shape, way or form. She should joyfully embrace all the intricacies that make her a woman, for she is fearfully and wonderfully made by her God and she belongs to Him.</p></div> <div class="page-edit"><!----> <!----></div> <div class="page-nav"><p class="inner"><span class="prev">
