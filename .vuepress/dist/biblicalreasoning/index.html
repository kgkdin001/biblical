It is a story where one God exercises His free will and authority to create all that is through the power of His word. It would take 6 days for the God of the Bible to create everything from the heavens and the earth to all living creatures upon the face of the earth. All the while saying as He created, “it is good”. In the eyes of God, creation is good. Genesis 1 &amp; 2 give the compelling picture of creation as it unfolded day after day. The word of God in creation is synonymous with Jesus. The Apostle John introduces Jesus in the first chapter of his book as “the Word”.  John chapter one almost mirrors Genesis 1 &amp; 2 by retelling the story of creation. John reminds us that through Jesus all things were made. In Genesis God separates the light from the darkness and in John the light shines in the darkness and never to be overcome by it.</p> <h2 id="it-is-very-good"><a href="#it-is-very-good" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> It is very good</h2> <p>Now, back to Genesis 1, God created mankind in His image and He said, “It is very good”. John 4:24 states that God is spirit and His worshipers must worship Him in spirit and in truth. Genesis one continues to say, God created mankind in His image that they may be fruitful and multiply as well as have dominion and authority over all that He had created. It would seem that an almighty God created mankind in order to bless them. Genesis 2 gives a more detailed account of the creation of mankind, it is here where we see that Adam the first man was formed from the soil and brought to life by the very breath of God. The Lord God Put the first man Adam in a beautiful garden called Eden and he was immediately put to work. Yes, Adam was to work and take care of the garden Eden.</p> <h2 id="free-will"><a href="#free-will" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Free will</h2> <p>The Lord God instructed the man; “you are free to eat from any tree in the garden but not from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, for when you eat from it you will certainly die”. The tree of the knowledge of good and evil was located in the middle of the garden, and next to it, was the tree of life. The man was free to eat his fill from the tree of life and thus never to see decay, however, he was prohibited from eating fruit from the tree that stood beside it. Yes, the fruit that would surely kill him and cause death of his spirit, soul and body (1 Thessalonians 5:23). The Lord God thus set before Adam the choice between life and death, choose life He beckoned (Deuteronomy 30:19).</p> <h2 id="the-fall"><a href="#the-fall" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> The Fall</h2> <p>While Adam was at work in the garden, naming animals of every kind, male and female as presented before him he saw that there was no suitable partner for him.  The Lord God was moved and saw that as perfect as he is, it was not good for Adam to be alone. In what would be an act only possible through the divine power of God, Adam was put into a deep sleep and God brought forth what was already created and hidden in the man Adam. Adam’s rib, Eve emerged from the porter’s hands, she was presented before the man Adam. “Woman” he named her and together they lived in the garden Eden, naked and without shame. This would conclude Genesis 2.</p> <p>As we enter Genesis 3, there is no knowing how long the first man and woman lived in the garden before the encounter that would alter humanity forever. It was a cool day when the crafty serpent appeared before Adam and Eve in the Garden, his agenda to deceive. Revelation 12:9 tells a story of the serpent of old who is called the devil and Satan, he deceives the whole world and his final judgment and destruction sure is to come. But, from where does this being called Satan come? This brings us to the creatures that God created before Adam and Eve, before Genesis. The creatures whose rank falls between God and humanity (Psalm 8:5), I’m talking about the angelic host of the Lord our God.</p> <p>The Bible teaches that angels do the Lords bidding, obey His word and are commanded by Him (Psalm 103:20; John 4:6).  Jesus told his disciples that he saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven (Luke 10:18). In Ezekiel 28, God when judging the king of Tyre metaphorically refers to him as “the seal of perfection, full of wisdom and perfect beauty, anointed as guardian cherub.” In Isaiah 1 a cherub is described as a majestic, four-winged creature that appears to guard and protect the very throne of God. Isaiah 28 continues to say of the guardian cherub “your heart became proud on account of your beauty, and you corrupted your wisdom because of your splendour. So I threw you to the earth and made a spectacle of you.”</p> <p>Interestingly, the Bible teaches yet again in Jude 1:6 of angels who did not keep their position of authority but abandoned their proper dwelling. Here, Satan also referred to as the great dragon, is said to be the leader of these fallen angels…a number amounting to a third of the angelic host prior to their fall (Revelation 12:4, Revelation 12:7-9).  Through scripture we learn that Satan deceived by his beauty, sinned against God and along with a third of the angels, fell from their position of authority and purpose as envisioned and destined by God. Now, back to the garden. This same Satan appears again, in the form of a snake and he tempts the woman Eve to eat the forbidden fruit. Genesis 3:6 reads; “when the woman saw that the fruit of the tree was good for food and pleasing to the eye, and also desirable for gaining wisdom, she took some and ate it. She also gave some to her husband, who was with her, and he ate it.” Thus, was the fall of man.</p> <h2 id="one-more-thing"><a href="#one-more-thing" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> One more thing</h2> <p>It would seem that the gift of freedom the Lord had granted Adam Eve, would cost them everything (i.e. freedom to obey or disobey God). This freedom which we commonly refer to as “free will” is a gift God did not take away even after the fall (Joshua 24 15; John 7:17; Romans 13:2; Deuteronomy 30:19). We do not know why God decided to give man so much power and we do not know why the fall of Adam and Eve transferred to their descendants. When sin, which is lawlessness (1 John 3:4), entered the heart of man through the act of disobedience, all of mankind would suffer the consequences. Indeed we still do.</p> <p>Note to reader:
The unconditional love of God is perfect because it is our choice to either reject or receive it. God wants us to love Him, want Him, run to Him, look to Him, and obey Him only if we choose and want to. He forces nothing on to us, He is gentle. Resist the serpent of old today and choose God. Receive Jesus into you heart today, confess with your mouth and believe in your heart and you will be saved. Amen.</p></div> <div class="page-edit"><!----> <!----></div> <div class="page-nav"><p class="inner"><!----> <span class="next"><a href="/biblicalreasoning/feminism.html">
